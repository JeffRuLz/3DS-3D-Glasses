# 3DS 3D Glasses App
Use your 3DS as a pair of 3D glasses. It kind of works.

It should go without saying but this will not work on a 2DS.

## Building
- Install [DevkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) with devkitARM and libctru.
- Install [bannertool](https://github.com/Steveice10/bannertool/releases).
- To just build a 3dsx file, run `make`
- To build a cia file, install [MakeROM](https://github.com/3DSGuy/Project_CTR/releases) and run `make cia`
